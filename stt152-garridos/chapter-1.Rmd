# Introduction
## Before Beginning

This book is designed as a companion to the [Regression Models](link url) Coursera class as part of the [Data Science Specialization⁶](link url), a ten course program offered by three faculty, Jeff Leek, Roger Peng and Brian Caffo, at the Johns Hopkins University Department of Biostatistics.

The videos associated with this book [can be watched in full here⁷](link url), though the relevant links to specific videos are placed at the appropriate locations throughout.

There is a wonderful Coursera class by Roger Peng, [that can be found here⁸](link url). In addition,
students should know the basics of frequentist statistical inference. There is a Coursera class [here⁹](link url) and a [LeanPub book here¹⁰](link url)

Finally, we should mention **swirl** (statistics with interactive R programming). **swirl** is an intelligent tutoring system developed by Nick Carchedi, with contributions by Sean Kross and Bill and Gina Croft. It offers a way to learn R in R. Download **swirl** [here¹³](link url). There’s a swirl module for this course!¹⁴.

## Motivating examples

*Regression models* are the *workhorse of data science*. They are the most well described, practical
and theoretically understood models in statistics. A data scientist well versed in regression models
will be able to solve an incredible array of problems.

The *key insight* for regression models is that *they produce highly interpretable model fits*.
This is unlike machine learning algorithms, which often sacrifice interpretability for improved
prediction performance or automation. 

## Motivating Examples
### Francis Galton's height data

Francis Galton, the 19th century polymath, can be credited with discovering regression. In his landmark paper [Regression Toward Mediocrity in Hereditary Stature¹⁶](link url) he compared the heights of parents and their children. He referred to this as “regression to mediocrity” (or regression to the mean). In quantifying regression to the mean, *he invented what we would call regression*

## Simply Statistics versus Kobe Bryant

[Simply Statistics¹⁸](link url) is a blog by Jeff Leek, Roger Peng and Rafael Irizarry. It is one of the most widely
read statistics blogs, written by three of the top statisticians in academics. Rafa wrote a (somewhat
tongue in cheek) [post regarding ball hogging¹⁹](link url) among NBA basketball players.

**key sentences:**
• “Data supports the claim that if Kobe stops ball hogging the Lakers will win more”
• “Linear regression suggests that an increase of 1% in % of shots taken by Kobe results in a drop
of 1.16 points (+/- 0.22) in score differential.”

## Summary Notes: questions for this book

Regression models are incredibly handy statistical tools. One can use them to answer all sorts of questions. Consider three of the most common tasks for regression models:

1. **Prediction** e.g.: to use the parent’s heights to predict children’s heights.
2. **Modeling** e.g.: to try to find a parsimonious, easily described mean relationship between parental and child heights.
3. **Covariation** e.g.: to investigate the variation in child heights that appears unrelated to parental heights (residual variation) and to quantify what impact genotype information has beyond parental height in explaining child height.

An important aspect, especially in questions 2 and 3 is assessing modeling assumptions. For example,
it is important to figure out how/whether and what assumptions are needed to generalize findings
beyond the data in question.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
